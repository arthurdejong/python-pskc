changes from 0.1 to 0.2
-----------------------

* raise exceptions on parsing, decryption and other problems
* support Python 2.6 and multiple ElementTree implementations (lxml is
  required when using Python 2.6)
* support more encryption algorithms (AES128-CBC, AES192-CBC, AES256-CBC,
  TripleDES-CBC, KW-AES128, KW-AES192, KW-AES256 and KW-TripleDES) and be
  more lenient in accepting algorithm URIs
* support all HMAC algorithms that Python's hashlib module has hash functions
  for (HMAC-MD5, HMAC-SHA1, HMAC-SHA224, HMAC-SHA256, HMAC-SHA384 and
  HMAC-SHA512)
* support PRF attribute of PBKDF2 algorithm
* support creating PSKC objects and keys
* when accessing values for which a MAC is present, a MAC failure will raise
  an exception (DecryptionError)
* many code cleanups
* improve test coverage
