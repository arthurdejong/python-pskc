changes from 0.4 to 0.5
-----------------------

* numerous compatibility improvements for reading PSKC files that do not
  follow the RFC 6030 schema exactly: specifically accept a number of old
  Internet Draft specifications that preceded RFC 6030 and support an
  ActivIdentity file format
* split device information from key information (keep old API available) to
  allow multiple keys per device (this is not allowed by RFC 6030 but was
  allowed in older Internet Drafts)
* accept MAC to be over plaintext in addition to ciphertext
* fall back to using encryption key as MAC key
* refactoring of some encryption, parsing and serialising functionality into
  separate modules for better maintainability
* add configuration for running test suite via Tox
* addition of a large number of test cases, bringing the branch coverage to
  100%
* documentation improvements
* drop official support for Python 2.6 (the module still works but is just no
  longer tested with it)


changes from 0.3 to 0.4
-----------------------

* add support for writing encrypted PSKC files (with either a pre-shared key
  or PBKDF2 password-based encryption)
* extend may_use() policy checking function to check for unknown policy
  elements and key expiry
* add a number of tests for existing vendor PSKC files and have full line
  coverage with tests
* be more lenient in handling a number of XML files (e.g. automatically
  sanitise encryption algorithm URIs, ignore XML namespaces and support more
  spellings of some properties)
* support reading password or key files in pskc2csv
* support Python 3 in the pskc2csv script (thanks Mathias Laurin)
* refactoring and clean-ups to be more easily extendible (thanks Mathias
  Laurin)


changes from 0.2 to 0.3
-----------------------

* support writing unencrypted PSKC files
* include a sample pskc2csv script in the source code
* fix an issue with XML namespaces for PBKDF2 parameters
* support Python 3
* update documentation


changes from 0.1 to 0.2
-----------------------

* raise exceptions on parsing, decryption and other problems
* support Python 2.6 and multiple ElementTree implementations (lxml is
  required when using Python 2.6)
* support more encryption algorithms (AES128-CBC, AES192-CBC, AES256-CBC,
  TripleDES-CBC, KW-AES128, KW-AES192, KW-AES256 and KW-TripleDES) and be
  more lenient in accepting algorithm URIs
* support all HMAC algorithms that Python's hashlib module has hash functions
  for (HMAC-MD5, HMAC-SHA1, HMAC-SHA224, HMAC-SHA256, HMAC-SHA384 and
  HMAC-SHA512)
* support PRF attribute of PBKDF2 algorithm
* support creating PSKC objects and keys
* when accessing values for which a MAC is present, a MAC failure will raise
  an exception (DecryptionError)
* many code cleanups
* improve test coverage
