changes from 1.2 to 1.3
-----------------------

* drop support for Python 2.7 and 3.5 (support Python 3.6 - 3.12)
* typo fixes in documentation
* have test suite not rely on current date/time
* update certificates in tests to support newer cryptography


changes from 1.1 to 1.2
-----------------------

* sort namespace declarations alphabetically in generated XML
* accept keys as bytearray values
* spelling fixes in documentation
* command-line utilities now support using - as stdin
* test and build environment improvements
* drop support for Python 3.4
* add support for Python 3.8 - 3.10 (was already working out-of-the-box)


changes from 1.0 to 1.1
-----------------------

* portability fixes for test suite
* add a remove_encryption() function
* always write a 1.0 PSKC version, even when another version was read
* correctly write a PSKC file with a global IV
* correctly write a PSKC file without a MAC key
* add a pskc2pskc script for converting a legacy PSKC file to a RFC 6030
  compliant version and for adding or removing encryption
* add a csv2pskc script for generating a PSKC file from a CSV file
* make all the scripts (pskc2csv, pskc2pskc and csv2pskc) entry points so
  they are available on package installation


changes from 0.5 to 1.0
-----------------------

* fix a bug in writing passphrase encrypted PSKC files on Python3
* fix a typo in the pin_max_failed_attempts attribute (the old name is
  available as a deprecated property)
* switch from pycrypto to cryptography as provider for encryption functions
  because the latter is better supported
* switch to using the PBKDF2 implementation from hashlib which requires
  Python 2.7.8 or newer
* use defusedxml when available (python-pskc now supports both standard
  xml.etree and lxml with and without defusedxml)
* support checking and generating embedded XML signatures (this requires the
  signxml library which is not required for any other operations)
* add limited support for very old draft PSKC versions (it is speculated that
  this resembles the "Verisign PSKC format" that some applications produce)
* support Camellia-CBC and KW-Camellia encryption algorithms
* support any hashing algorithm available in Python
* add a --secret-encoding option to pskc2csv to allow base64 encoded binary
  output
* support naming the CSV column headers in pskc2csv
* add a manual page for pskc2csv
* a number of documentation, code style and test suite improvements


changes from 0.4 to 0.5
-----------------------

* numerous compatibility improvements for reading PSKC files that do not
  follow the RFC 6030 schema exactly: specifically accept a number of old
  Internet Draft specifications that preceded RFC 6030 and support an
  ActivIdentity file format
* split device information from key information (keep old API available) to
  allow multiple keys per device (this is not allowed by RFC 6030 but was
  allowed in older Internet Drafts)
* accept MAC to be over plaintext in addition to ciphertext
* fall back to using encryption key as MAC key
* refactoring of some encryption, parsing and serialising functionality into
  separate modules for better maintainability
* add configuration for running test suite via Tox
* addition of a large number of test cases, bringing the branch coverage to
  100%
* documentation improvements
* drop official support for Python 2.6 (the module still works but is just no
  longer tested with it)


changes from 0.3 to 0.4
-----------------------

* add support for writing encrypted PSKC files (with either a pre-shared key
  or PBKDF2 password-based encryption)
* extend may_use() policy checking function to check for unknown policy
  elements and key expiry
* add a number of tests for existing vendor PSKC files and have full line
  coverage with tests
* be more lenient in handling a number of XML files (e.g. automatically
  sanitise encryption algorithm URIs, ignore XML namespaces and support more
  spellings of some properties)
* support reading password or key files in pskc2csv
* support Python 3 in the pskc2csv script (thanks Mathias Laurin)
* refactoring and clean-ups to be more easily extendible (thanks Mathias
  Laurin)


changes from 0.2 to 0.3
-----------------------

* support writing unencrypted PSKC files
* include a sample pskc2csv script in the source code
* fix an issue with XML namespaces for PBKDF2 parameters
* support Python 3
* update documentation


changes from 0.1 to 0.2
-----------------------

* raise exceptions on parsing, decryption and other problems
* support Python 2.6 and multiple ElementTree implementations (lxml is
  required when using Python 2.6)
* support more encryption algorithms (AES128-CBC, AES192-CBC, AES256-CBC,
  TripleDES-CBC, KW-AES128, KW-AES192, KW-AES256 and KW-TripleDES) and be
  more lenient in accepting algorithm URIs
* support all HMAC algorithms that Python's hashlib module has hash functions
  for (HMAC-MD5, HMAC-SHA1, HMAC-SHA224, HMAC-SHA256, HMAC-SHA384 and
  HMAC-SHA512)
* support PRF attribute of PBKDF2 algorithm
* support creating PSKC objects and keys
* when accessing values for which a MAC is present, a MAC failure will raise
  an exception (DecryptionError)
* many code cleanups
* improve test coverage
