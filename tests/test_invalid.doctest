>>> from binascii import a2b_hex
>>> from pskc import PSKC


Load a number of invalid files.


This file is plain invalid XML.

>>> pskc = PSKC('tests/invalid-notxml.pskcxml')
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
ParseError: Error parsing XML


This XML file has a wrong top-level element.

>>> pskc = PSKC('tests/invalid-wrongelement.pskcxml')
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
ParseError: Missing KeyContainer


This file has an unknown PSKC version.

>>> pskc = PSKC('tests/invalid-wrongversion.pskcxml')
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
ParseError: Unsupported version


This PSKC file has one key with an unknown algorithm and one key without an
algorithm specified.

>>> pskc = PSKC('tests/invalid-encryption.pskcxml')
>>> key = pskc.keys[0]
>>> key.id
'12345678'
>>> key.secret
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
DecryptionError: No key available
>>> pskc.encryption.key = a2b_hex('12345678901234567890123456789012')
>>> key.secret
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
DecryptionError: Unsupported algorithm: ...
>>> key = pskc.keys[1]
>>> key.id
'45678901'
>>> key.secret
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
DecryptionError: No algorithm specified


Specify an unknown key derivation algorithm specified.

>>> pskc = PSKC('tests/rfc6030-figure7.pskcxml')
>>> pskc.encryption.derivation.algorithm = 'unknown'
>>> pskc.encryption.derive_key('qwerty')
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
KeyDerivationError: Unsupported algorithm: ...


Figure 6 does use encryption but with a pre-shared key. Attempting key
derivation with such a PSKC file should result in an exception.

>>> pskc = PSKC('tests/rfc6030-figure6.pskcxml')
>>> pskc.encryption.derive_key('qwerty')
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
KeyDerivationError: No algorithm specified


Specify an unknown PBKDF2 PRF (pseudorandom function).

>>> pskc = PSKC('tests/rfc6030-figure7.pskcxml')
>>> pskc.encryption.derivation.pbkdf2_prf = 'unknown'
>>> pskc.encryption.derive_key('qwerty')
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
KeyDerivationError: Pseudorandom function unsupported: ...


There is a ValueMAC element but no MACMethod element.

>>> pskc = PSKC('tests/invalid-no-mac-method.pskcxml')
>>> pskc.encryption.key = a2b_hex('12345678901234567890123456789012')
>>> key = pskc.keys[0]
>>> key.id
'12345678'
>>> key.secret
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
DecryptionError: No MAC key available


There is an unknown algorithm specified in MACMethod.

>>> pskc = PSKC('tests/invalid-mac-algorithm.pskcxml')
>>> pskc.encryption.key = a2b_hex('12345678901234567890123456789012')
>>> key = pskc.keys[0]
>>> key.id
'12345678'
>>> key.secret
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
DecryptionError: Unsupported MAC algorithm: ...


The MAC value does not match the calculated MAC, something was modified in
transit.

>>> pskc = PSKC('tests/invalid-mac-value.pskcxml')
>>> pskc.encryption.key = a2b_hex('12345678901234567890123456789012')
>>> key = pskc.keys[0]
>>> key.id
'12345678'
>>> key.secret
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
DecryptionError: MAC value does not match
