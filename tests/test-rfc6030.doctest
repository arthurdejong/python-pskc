>>> from pskc import PSKC


This tests Figure 2 from RFC6030. It is a basic key container example with
a simple plain text secret key.

>>> pskc = PSKC('tests/rfc6030-figure2.pskc')
>>> [key.secret for key in pskc.keys]
['1234']
>>> key = pskc.keys[0]
>>> key.id
'12345678'
>>> key.algorithm
'urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:keyprov:pskc:hotp'
>>> key.issuer
'Issuer-A'
>>> key.secret
'1234'
