This directory contains keys and certificates that are used in the
python-pskc test suite for checking XML signatures.

The CA key and certificate were generated with:

openssl req \
  -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes \
  -keyout ca-key.pem -out ca-certificate.pem \
  -days 3650 -subj '/C=NL/O=python-pskc/CN=Test CA'

The key used for signing the PSKC files and corresponding self-signed
certificate were generated with:

openssl req \
  -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes \
  -keyout key.pem -out ss-certificate.pem \
  -days 3650 -subj '/C=NL/O=python-pskc/CN=Test signing'

The certificate signed by the CA key was generated with:

openssl req \
  -new \
  -key key.pem -out request.pem \
  -subj '/C=NL/O=python-pskc/CN=Test signing'

openssl x509 \
  -req \
  -in request.pem -CA ca-certificate.pem -CAkey ca-key.pem -out certificate.pem \
  -days 3650 -set_serial 42
