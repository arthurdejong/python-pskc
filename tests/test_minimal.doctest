>>> from pskc import PSKC


This tests the most minimal valid PSKC file with one empty key.

>>> import StringIO
>>> minimal_pskc = StringIO.StringIO('''
... <?xml version="1.0"?>
... <KeyContainer xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:keyprov:pskc" Version="1.0">
...   <KeyPackage/>
... </KeyContainer>
... '''.strip())
>>> pskc = PSKC(minimal_pskc)
>>> [key.id for key in pskc.keys]
[None]


Check creation of empty PSKC structure and adding an empty key to the list.

>>> pskc = PSKC()
>>> key = pskc.add_key(id='123')
>>> key.id
'123'
>>> key.secret is None
True

Adding a key with unknown attributes raises an error.
>>> key = pskc.add_key(foo='bar')
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
AttributeError
