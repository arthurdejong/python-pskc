>>> from pskc import PSKC


This tests Figure 2 from RFC6030. It is a basic key container example with
a simple plain text secret key.

>>> pskc = PSKC('tests/rfc6030-figure2.pskc')
>>> [key.secret for key in pskc.keys]
['1234']
>>> key = pskc.keys[0]
>>> key.id
'12345678'
>>> key.algorithm
'urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:keyprov:pskc:hotp'
>>> key.issuer
'Issuer-A'
>>> key.secret
'1234'


This tests Figure 3 from RFC6030. Relative to Figure 2 this includes
device, cryptographic module and user identification as well as some more
parameters.

>>> pskc = PSKC('tests/rfc6030-figure3.pskc')
>>> pskc.id
'exampleID1'
>>> key = pskc.keys[0]
>>> key.manufacturer
'Manufacturer'
>>> key.serial
'987654321'
>>> key.device_userid
'DC=example-bank,DC=net'
>>> key.crypto_module
'CM_ID_001'
>>> key.id
'12345678'
>>> key.algorithm
'urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:keyprov:pskc:hotp'
>>> key.issuer
'Issuer'
>>> key.response_encoding
'DECIMAL'
>>> key.response_length
8
>>> key.secret
'12345678901234567890'
>>> key.counter
0
>>> key.userid
'UID=jsmith,DC=example-bank,DC=net'


This tests Figure 4 from RFC6030. In this case the key value itself is not
contained but can be derived using the serial and out-of-band agreements
on the meanings of key_profile and key_reference.

>>> pskc = PSKC('tests/rfc6030-figure4.pskc')
>>> key = pskc.keys[0]
>>> key.serial
'987654321'
>>> key.key_profile
'keyProfile1'
>>> key.key_reference
'MasterKeyLabel'
>>> key.counter
0
