Python PSKC module
==================

A Python module to handle Portable Symmetric Key Container (PSKC) files as
defined in `RFC 6030 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6030>`_. PSKC files are
used to transport and provision symmetric keys and key meta data (seed files)
to different types of crypto modules, commonly one-time password tokens or
other authentication devices.

This module can be used to extract keys from PSKC files for use in an OTP
authentication system. The module can also be used for authoring PSKC files.

API
---

The module provides a straightforward API that is mostly geared towards
parsing existing PSKC files.

Extracting key material from encrypted PSKC files is as simple as:

>>> from pskc import PSKC
>>> pskc = PSKC('tests/rfc6030/figure7.pskcxml')
>>> pskc.encryption.derive_key('qwerty')
>>> for key in pskc.keys:
...     print key.serial, key.secret
987654321 12345678901234567890

Writing am encrypted PSKC file is as simple as:

>>> pskc = PSKC()
>>> key = pskc.add_key(
...     id='456', secret='987654321', manufacturer='Manufacturer',
...     algorithm = 'urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:keyprov:pskc:hotp')
>>> pskc.encryption.setup_pbkdf2('passphrase')
>>> pskc.write('output.pskcxml')

The key object has a number of properties. See the pskc.key.Key documentation
for details.


Security considerations
-----------------------

This code handles private key material and is written in Python. No
precautions have been taken to lock pages in memory to prevent swapping. Also
no attempt is currently made to security dispose of memory that may have held
private key material.

Development notes
-----------------

This package should use a mostly standard source code layout and support both
Python 2 (2.6 but 2.7 is recommended) and Python 3 (most recent versions
should work). The tests can be run with nosetests and the aim is to have
maximum code coverage.
