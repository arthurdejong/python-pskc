# Python PSKC module #

A Python module to handle Portable Symmetric Key Container (PSKC) files as
defined in RFC6030. PSKC files are used to transport and provision
symmetric keys to different types of crypto modules, commonly one-time
password tokens or other authentication devices.

The goal of this module is mainly to provide parsing of PSKC files in
order to extract secret keys for use in an OTP authentication system. At a
later time support for writing files may be added.

## Security considerations ##

This code handles private key material and is written in Python. No
precautions have been taken to lock pages in memory to prevent swapping.
Also no attempt is currently made to security dispose of memory that may
have held private key material.
