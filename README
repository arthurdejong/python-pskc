Python PSKC module
==================

A Python module to handle Portable Symmetric Key Container (PSKC) files as
defined in `RFC6030 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6030>`_. PSKC files are
used to transport and provision symmetric keys and key related meta data to
different types of crypto modules. The format is commonly used for one-time
password tokens or other authentication devices.

The goal of this module is mainly to provide parsing of PSKC files in
order to extract secret keys for use in an OTP authentication system. At a
later time support for writing files may be added.

API
---

The module provides a straightforward API that is mostly geared towards
parsing existing PSKC files.

Extracting key matarial from PSKC files is as simple as.

>>> from pskc import PSKC
>>> pskc = PSKC('tests/rfc6030-figure7.pskcxml')
>>> pskc.encryption.derive_key('qwerty')
>>> for key in pskc.keys:
...     print key.serial, key.secret
987654321 12345678901234567890

The key object has a number of properties. See the pskc.key.Key documentation
for details.


Security considerations
-----------------------

This code handles private key material and is written in Python. No
precautions have been taken to lock pages in memory to prevent swapping.
Also no attempt is currently made to security dispose of memory that may
have held private key material.
